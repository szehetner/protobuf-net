# Release Notes

Packages are available on NuGet: [protobuf-net](https://www.nuget.org/packages/protobuf-net)

protobuf-net needs to be built with MSBuild, due to some of the target platforms.

The easiest way to do this is via Visual Studio 2017 ([community edition is free](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)) - build `src\protobuf-net.sln`

## (not yet started)

- gRPC?
- build-time tooling from code-first
- `dynamic` API over types known only via descriptors loaded at runtime
- `Any` support


## v3.0.0-alpha.3

- **breaking change** (hence 3.0) if you are using `new ProtoReader(...)` - you must now use `ProtoReader.Create(...)`
- if using `ProtoReader` you *should* now move to the `ref State` API too, although the old API will continue to
  work with `Stream`-based readers; it **will not** work with `ReadOnlySequence<byte>` readers
- "pipelines" (`ReadOnlySequence<byte>`) support for the **read** API (not write yet)
- significant performance improvements in all read scenarios
- new `CreateForAssembly(...)` API (various overloads) for working with precompiled (at runtime) type models (faster than `RuntimeTypeModel`, but less flexible)
- significant amounts of code tidying; many yaks were shawn

## v2.4.0

- fix #442 - switched to 2.4.0 due to new versioning implementation breaking the assembly version; oops

## v2.3.17

- (#430/#431) - ensure build output from `protobuf-net.MSBuild` makes it into build output; add error codes
- #429 - use `$IntermediateOutputPath` correctly from build tools

## v2.3.16

- new MSBuild .proto tools added (huge thanks go to Mark Pflug here)
- fix error where extension GetValues might only report the last item
- switch to git-based versioning implementation; versioning now unified over all tools
- extensions codegen (C#): add `Get*` and `Add*` implementations for `repeated`; add `Set*` implementations for regular
- update `protoc` to 3.6.1
- give advance warning of possible removal of ProtoReader/ProtoWriter constructors
- codegen (C#): implement "listset" option to control whether lists/maps get `set` accessors
- `GetProto<T>` now emits `oneof`-style .proto syntax for inheritance

## protobuf-net v2.3.15

- merge #412/fix #408 - `ReadObject`/`WriteObject` failed on value types
- merge #421 - support `IReadOnlyCollection` members
- merge #424 - make WCF configuration features available on TFMs that support them

## protobuf-net v2.3.13

- **IMPORTANT** fix #403 - key cache was incorrect in some cases involving multi-level inheritance; update from 2.3.8 or above is highly recommended

## protobuf-net v2.3.12

- fix #402 - zero `decimal` with non-trivial sign/scale should round-trip correctly
- fix additional scenarios for #401

## protobuf-net v2.3.11

- explicitly prevent `MetaType` instances for arrays

## v2.3.0-alpha

- [further reading](https://blog.marcgravell.com/2017/06/protobuf-net-gets-proto3-support.html)
- proto2/proto3 DSL processing tools to make a resurgance; [preview is available here](https://protogen.marcgravell.com/)
- proto3 schema generation
- full support for `map<,>`, `Timestamp`, `Duration`
- dictionaries are now "maps" by default - duplicated keys *replace* values rather than causing exceptions
- support for one-of
- enums are now "pass thru" whenever possible - unknown values will not normally cause exceptions (this indirectly fixes #260, but proto3 semantics was the motivation)
- various bug-fixes
 - fix bug in schema output forn enums withut a zero value (#224)

## v2.2.1

- critical bug fix [#256](https://github.com/protobuf-net/protobuf-net/issues/256) - length-based readers are failing; if you are using 2.2.0, please update as soon as possible (this bug was introduced in 2.2.0)
- fix #241 - check all callback parameters (signature validation)
- removed `[Obsolete]` markers left in place during 64-bit updates
- release string interner earlier (keeps a possibly-large array reachable)
- various documentation fixes (#184, #189, #216)

## v2.2.0

- enable 64-bit processing (2GiB+ file sizes) *within constraints* that no single sub-graph can exceed 2GiB; this is assisted by...
- new `IsGroup` property on `[ProtoContract(...)]` that indicates that a type should always be treated as a group (rather than having to specify "group" per-member); groups do not require length-prefix or buffering, so are trivially usable in huge files
- support get-only automatically-implemented properties (#188)
- support `ValueTuple<...>`
- fix bug with cyclic types resolving as lists (#167)
- optimized encoding of packed fixed-length primitives (in particular, arrays)
